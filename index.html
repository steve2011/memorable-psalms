    1 Blessed is the one
        who does not walk in step with the wicked
    or stand in the way that sinners take
        or sit in the company of mockers,
    2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
        and who meditates on his law day and night.
    3 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
        which yields its fruit in season
    and whose leaf does not wither—
        whatever they do prospers.

             A psalm of David.
        1 Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent?
            Who may live on your holy mountain?
        2 The one whose walk is blameless,
            who does what is righteous,
            who speaks the truth from their heart;
        3 whose tongue utters no slander,
            who does no wrong to a neighbor,
            and casts no slur on others;
        4 who despises a vile person
            but honors those who fear the Lord;
        who keeps an oath even when it hurts,
            and does not change their mind;
        5 who lends money to the poor without interest;
            who does not accept a bribe against the innocent.
        Whoever does these things
            will never be shaken.

            1 The Lord is my light and my salvation—
                whom shall I fear?
            The Lord is the stronghold of my life—
                of whom shall I be afraid?

            2 When the wicked advance against me
                to devour[a] me,
            it is my enemies and my foes
                who will stumble and fall.
            3 Though an army besiege me,
                my heart will not fear;
            though war break out against me,
                even then I will be confident.

            4 One thing I ask from the Lord,
                this only do I seek:
            that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
                all the days of my life,
            to gaze on the beauty of the Lord
                and to seek him in his temple.
            5 For in the day of trouble
                he will keep me safe in his dwelling;
            he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent
                and set me high upon a rock.

            6 Then my head will be exalted
                above the enemies who surround me;
            at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy;
             I will sing and make music to the Lord.

            13 I remain confident of this:
                I will see the goodness of the Lord
                in the land of the living.

            2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
                When can I go and meet with God?
            3 My tears have been my food

            4 These things I remember
                as I pour out my soul:
            how I used to go to the house of God
                under the protection of the Mighty One[d]
            with shouts of joy and praise
                among the festive throng.

     <h1>Psalm 51:Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.</h1> 
     <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: cursive; font-weight: 700">Psalm 51 is a renowned expression of repentance. David, the greatest of Israel's kings, fell into serious sin and recognized his need to plead with God for forgiveness. This confession was inspired by David's sins of adultery, deception, and even murder in his relationship with Bathsheba.</p>

            4 Against You, You only, have I sinned,
            And done this evil in Your sight—
            That You may be found just [a]when You speak,
            And blameless when You judge.

            5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
            And in sin my mother conceived me.
            6 Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts,
            And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.

            Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
            8 Make me hear joy and gladness,
            That the bones You have broken may rejoice.
            9 Hide Your face from my sins,

                       Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men;
                Preserve me from violent men,
                2 Who plan evil things in their hearts;
                They continually gather together for war.
                3 They sharpen their tongues like a serpent;
                The poison of asps is under their lips. Selah

                4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked;
                Preserve me from violent men,
                Who have purposed to make my steps stumble.
                5 The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords;
                They have spread a net by the wayside;
                They have set traps for me. Selah

                6 I said to the Lord: “You are my God;
                Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord.
                     7 O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
            You have [a]covered my head in the day of battle.

            8 Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked;
            Do not further his wicked scheme,
            Lest they be exalted. Selah

            9 “As for the head of those who surround me,
            Let the evil of their lips cover them;
            10 Let burning coals fall upon them;
            Let them be cast into the fire,
            Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
            11 Let not a slanderer be established in the earth;
            Let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him.”

            12 I know that the Lord will maintain
            The cause of the afflicted,
            And justice for the poor.
            13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name;
            The upright shall dwell in Your presence.

          1 Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High

     will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. 

    2 I will say of the Lord, "He is my refuge 

    and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."

    3 Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare 

    and from the deadly pestilence. 

    4 He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings 

    you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. 

    5 You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,</p>

           6 nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, 

    nor the plague that destroys at midday. 

    7 A thousand may fall at your side, 

    ten thousand at your right hand, 

    but it will not come near you. 

    8 You will only observe with your eyes 

    and see the punishment of the wicked.

    9 If you say, "The Lord is my refuge," 

    and you make the Most High your dwelling, 

    10 no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent.
    11 For he will command his angels concerning you

    to guard you in all your ways; 
    12 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you

    will not strike your foot against a stone.

        13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra;

         you will trample the great lion and the serpent.

        14 "Because he loves me," says the Lord, 

        "I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. 

        15 He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, 

        I will deliver him and honor him. 

        16 With long life, I will satisfy him and show him my salvation."</p>
